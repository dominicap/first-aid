## Grid Submission

#### Grid Name

* Education.grid -> Stores reliable education links and returns relevant links based on searches.

#### Grid Description

* Our grid will contain a list of reputable education resources and the content those resources serve which will include articles (text), video, and images.

#### Who Is It For?

* Students who need help for their homework and don't want to spend up to hours on Google looking for a solution

#### Why Is This Important?

* Every student in the U.S. gets homework piled on them daily. These students then proceed to Google many questions. However, the immense amount of resources make searching Google very time consuming. This grid paired with our web app would allow students to retrieve only the most relevant information for their question.

#### Reliable Sources

* [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org)
